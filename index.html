      <p>Since leaving the military signal corps in 1993, I've been in telecom ever since. Starting with small key systems at various companies around Kansas city. 
          In 1996 I started to travel the United States for a large customer. After that I got into larger PBX systems, and doing work with 
        governmental agencies. I joined Sprint for the launch of PCS in 1999. With Sprint I was able to be on the team
      to be one of the first organizations to bring data to a mobile phone. This was done with a joint venture with Yahoo! at the time.

      Since then I have been with multiple enterprise OEM's. To launch 3G service for the 2000 Olympics in Australia, and various South American countries after that.
      While doing this I had to acquire coding experience in order to create automation, and testing. Also along the way I've picked up some certifications like CCNA, SCSA, and MCSE.
